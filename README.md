# Todoy (todo-ee)

## What?

A todo app created by following a tutorial. I thought the app based of the
tutorial could be turned into a slightly larger project for a tutorial series so
that's what I'm doing

## Why

- The tutorial seem to skip over some things and confuse a friend of mine
- There are some things I know now that would have been usefull in the begining
  of learning web dev
- I want to learn how to write tutorials well... GL me
